This repository contains the source code of my own version of Cards Against Humanity.
#
Cards against humanity is a card game where every player is given white cards in their hand. Those white cards contain some words or sentence. Every round one black card is drawn to the table. The black card contains a sentence where there are 1 - 3 blank spaces. You have to select white cards from your hand to fill in those blanks and to make a full sentence which hopefully is as funny as possible. Then when all players have chosen their white cards to fill in the blanks, one player who was assigned in the beginning of the round to be a selector, selects the funniest white cards. The player who played those white cards gets a point. Then the next round begins and new black card and selector are selected.
